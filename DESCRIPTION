Description: When evaluating the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS), it is important to perform a quality control to ensure that the results are valid, complete, correctly formatted, and, in case of meta-analysis, consistent with other studies that have applied the same analysis. This package was developed to facilitate and streamline this process and provide the user with a comprehensive report.
